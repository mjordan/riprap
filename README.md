A fixity-auditing microservice that addresses https://github.com/Islandora-CLAW/CLAW/issues/847. Developed as a successfor to Islandora 7.x's [Checksum Checker](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_checksum_checker) module, it is intended primarily to be used with repositories compliant with the [Fedora API Specification](https://fedora.info/spec/), but can be used to provide fixity validation for other repositories as well (e.g., an [OCFL](https://ocfl.io/) repository). In fact, Riprap ships with sample plugins that allow it to monitor the fixity of files on a standard attached filesystem and call `sha1sum` to get their current digests.

Riprap periodcally requests fixity digests for resources from a repository and compares the digest with a previously request digest. It then persists the outocome of that comparison so the process can be repeated again. Riprap also provides a REST interface so that external applications (in Islandora's case, Drupal) can retrieve fixity checking event data for use in reports, etc.

![Overview](docs/images/overview.png)

Riprap generates and records fixity check events as described in the "Fixity, integrity, authenticity" section of the [PREMIS Data Dictionary for Preservation Metadata, Version 3.0](https://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/v3/premis-3-0-final.pdf). It can also record fixity information available during "ingestion" events and available at the time of "deletion" events. "fixity check" events are generated by Riprap, typically in a job scheduled via `cron`, but "ingestion" and "deletion" events are generated by external systems, which may persist information about those events at any time in Riprap's database via either its REST API or via an ActiveMQ message. Initial fixity checks (that is, after a resource is ingested into the repository) and final fixity checks (just before a resource is deleted from the repository) can be identified by adding a brief note to the event.

All events must have a value of `success` or `fail`, using values from the Library of Congress' Preservation [Event Outcome](http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/preservation/eventOutcome.html) vocabulary.

## Current status

Riprap's major functionality is in place, with the exception of the ActiveMQ event queue listener. Additional funcitonality can be added via new plugins.

## Requirements

* PHP 7.1.3 or higher
* [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* An SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL relational database, with appropriate PHP drivers.

While not a requirement, a [module for Islandora](https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_riprap) is available that provides node-level reports on binary resources using data from Riprap.

## Installation

1. Clone this git repository
1. `cd riprap`
1. `php composer.phar install` (or equivalent on your system, e.g., `./composer install`)
1. Create the database as described in the next section.

We will eventually support deployment via Ansible.

## Trying it out

If you want to play with Riprap, and you're on a Linux or OSX machine, you should not need to configure anything. However, you will need to choose which relational database to use.

Assuming you have the database installed installed and configured properly (as described below), you should be able to run the `check_fixity` command against the sample data and local web server, and perform basic API requests as documented below. A couple of things you will want to know:

* Riprap will write its log to `/tmp/riprap.log`
* the test webserver runs on port 8000

### Using SQLite

To create the database that Riprap persists fixity event data into, follow these instructions from within the `riprap` directory:

1. Edit .env so that this line is uncommented: `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///%kernel.project_dir%/var/data.db` and the other lines starting with `DATABASE_URL` are commented out.
1. `rm var/data.db` (might not exist)
1. `rm src/Migrations/*` (might be empty)
1. `php bin/console -n make:migration`
1. `php bin/console -n doctrine:migrations:migrate`
1. Optional: When you run the `check_fixity` command as described below, it will create events based on the fixity checks. If you want to populate the database with some sample fixity events prior to running `check_fixity` (you don't need to), run `php bin/console -n doctrine:fixtures:load`

### Using MySQL

In `config/packages/doctrine.yaml`, make sure you have:

```
doctrine:
    dbal:
        driver: 'pdo_mysql'
        server_version: '5.7' # Or whatever version you are running.
        charset: utf8mb4
        default_table_options:
            charset: utf8mb4
            collate: utf8mb4_unicode_ci
```
Then follow these instructions from within the `riprap` directory:

1. Create a MySQL user with `create` privileges
1. Edit .env so that this line contains the user, password, and database name you want: `DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@127.0.0.1:3306/riprap` and the other lines starting with DATABASE_URL are commented out.
1. `rm src/Migrations/*` (might be empty)
1. `php bin/console doctrine:database:create`
1. `php bin/console -n make:migration`
1. `php bin/console -n doctrine:migrations:migrate`
1. Optional: When you run the `check_fixity` command as described below, it will create events based on the fixity checks. If you want to populate the database with some sample fixity events prior to running `check_fixity` (you don't need to), run `php bin/console -n doctrine:fixtures:load`

### Using PostgreSQL

In `config/packages/doctrine.yaml`, make sure you have:

```
doctrine:
    dbal:
        driver: 'pdo_pgsql'
        charset: utf8
```
Then follow these instructions from within the `riprap` directory:

1. Create a PostgreSQL user with 'createdb` privileges
1. Edit .env so that this line contains the user, password, and database name you want: `DATABASE_URL=pgsql://user:password@127.0.0.1:5432/riprap` and the other lines starting with DATABASE_URL are commented out.
1. `rm src/Migrations/*` (might be empty)
1. `php bin/console doctrine:database:create`
1. `php bin/console -n make:migration`
1. `php bin/console -n doctrine:migrations:migrate`
1. Optional: When you run the `check_fixity` command as described below, it will create events based on the fixity checks. If you want to populate the database with some sample fixity events prior to running `check_fixity` (you don't need to), run `php bin/console -n doctrine:fixtures:load`

### Running the check_fixity command

From within the `riprap` directory, start the web server by running the `server:start` command. Then, run the `app:riprap:check_fixity` command, e.g.:

* `php bin/console server:start`
* `php bin/console app:riprap:check_fixity`

You should see output similar to:

`Riprap checked 5 resources (5 successful events, 0 failed events) in 0.223 seconds.`

Here is what is going on when you run the `check_fixity` command:

1. Riprap calls whatever `fetchresourcelist` plugins are enabled (there can be more than one), and from them gets a list of all resources to check. In the default sample configuration, this list of resources is a plain text file at `resources/iprap_resource_ids.txt`.
1. For each of the resources identifed by the `fetchresourcelist` plugins, Riprap calls the `fetchdigest` plugin that is enabled, and gets the resource's digest value from the repository. In the default sample configuration, Riprap is calling its mock repository endpoint.
1. Riprap then gets the digest value in the most recent fixity check event stored in its database (in the default sample configuration, this is fixity events stored in the relational database), and compares the newly retrieved digest value with the most recent one on record.
1. Riprap then persists information about the fixity check event it just performed (in the default sample configuration, back into the SQLite database). If you repeat the SQL query above, you will see five more events in your database, one corresponding to each URL listed in `resources/iprap_resource_ids.txt`.
1. Riprap then executes all `postcheck` plugins that are enabled.
1. After Riprap has checked all resources in the current list, it reports out how many resources it checked, including how many checks were successful and how many failed.

If you query the table you will see the following output (this example uses SQLite, but the `SELECT` statement works in all relational databases):

```
SQLite version 3.22.0 2018-01-22 18:45:57
Enter ".help" for usage hints.

```
If you populated the database prior to running `check_fixity`, you will see 20 additional events in the database.

### REST API

Preliminary scaffolding is in place for a simple HTTP REST API, which will allow external applications like Drupal to retrieve fixity check data on specific Fedora resources and to add new and updated fixity check data. For example, a `GET` request to:

`curl -v -H "Resource-ID:http://example.com/repository/resource/12345" http://localhost:8000/api/fixity`

would return a list of all fixity events for the Fedora resource `http://example.com/repository/resource/12345`.

To see the API in action,

1. run `php bin/console server:start`
1. run `curl -v -H 'Resource-ID:http://localhost:8000/mockrepository/rest/10' http://localhost:8000/api/fixity`

You should get a response like this:

```
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8000 (#0)
> GET /api/fixity HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8000
> User-Agent: curl/7.58.0
> Accept: */*
> Resource-ID:http://localhost:8000/mockrepository/rest/10
> 
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Host: localhost:8000
< Date: Sun, 30 Sep 2018 10:13:49 -0700
< Connection: close
< X-Powered-By: PHP/7.2.10-0ubuntu0.18.04.1
< Cache-Control: no-cache, private
< Date: Sun, 30 Sep 2018 17:13:49 GMT
< Content-Type: application/json
< 
```

The returned JSON looks like this:

```javascript
[
   {
      "event_uuid":"4cd2edc9-f292-49a1-9b05-d025684de559",
      "resource_id":"http:\/\/localhost:8000\/mockrepository\/rest\/10",
      "event_type":"fix",
      "timestamp":"2018-10-03T07:23:40-07:00",
      "hash_algorithm":"SHA-1",
      "hash_value":"c28097ad29ab61bfec58d9b4de53bcdec687872e",
      "event_detail":"Initial fixity check.",
      "event_outcome":"suc",
      "event_outcome_detail_note":""
   },
   {
      "event_uuid":"fb73a36a-df64-4ba8-a437-ea277b65ebb7",
      "resource_id":"http:\/\/localhost:8000\/mockrepository\/rest\/10",
      "event_type":"fix",
      "timestamp":"2018-12-03T07:26:39-07:00",
      "hash_algorithm":"SHA-1",
      "hash_value":"c28097ad29ab61bfec58d9b4de53bcdec687872e",
      "event_detail":"",
      "event_outcome":"suc",
      "event_outcome_detail_note":""
   }
   [...]
]
```
Note that if the resource identified by `Resource-ID` does not have any events in Riprap, the REST API will return a `200` response and an empty body, e.g.,

```javascript
[]
```

This means that consumers of this API will need to not only check for the HTTP response code, but also count the number of members in the returned list.

HTTP `POST` and `PATCH` will also be supported, e.g.:

```
curl -v -X POST -H "Resource-ID:http://localhost:8080/mockrepository/rest/17" http://localhost:8000/api/fixity
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8000 (#0)
> POST /api/fixity HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8000
> User-Agent: curl/7.58.0
> Accept: */*
> Resource-ID:http://localhost:8080/mockrepository/rest/17
> 
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Host: localhost:8000
< Date: Thu, 27 Sep 2018 11:56:02 -0700
< Connection: close
< X-Powered-By: PHP/7.2.10-0ubuntu0.18.04.1
< Cache-Control: no-cache, private
< Date: Thu, 27 Sep 2018 18:56:02 GMT
< Content-Type: application/json
< 
* Closing connection 0
["new fixity event for resource http:\/\/localhost:8080\/mockrepository\/rest\/17"]
```

`GET` requests can optionally take the following URL parameters:

* `timestamp_start`: ISO8601 (full or partial) date indicating start of date range in queries.
* `timestamp_end`: ISO8601 (full or partial) date indicating end of date range in queries.
* `outcome`: Coded outcome of the event, either `suc` or `fail`.
* `offset`: The number of items in the result set, starting at the beginning, that are skipped in the result set (i.e., same as standard SQL use of 'offset'). Default is 0.
* `limit`: Number of items in the result set to return, starting at the value of `offset`.
* `sort`: Sort events on timestamp. Specify "desc" or "asc" (if not present, will sort "asc").

For example, `curl -v -H 'Resource-ID:http://localhost:8000/mockrepository/rest/10' http://localhost:8000/api/fixity?timestamp_start=2018-12-03` would return only the events for `http://localhost:8000/mockrepository/rest/10` that have a timestamp equal to or later than `2018-12-03`.

## Mock Fedora repository endpoint

To assist in development and testing, Riprap includes an endpoint that simulates the behaviour described in section [7.2](https://fcrepo.github.io/fcrepo-specification/#persistence-fixity) of the spec. If you start Symfony's test server as described above, this endpoint is available via `GET` or `HEAD` requests at `http://localhost:8000/mockrepository/rest/{id}`, where `{id}` is a number from 1-20 (these are mock "resource IDs" included in the sample data). Calls to it should include a `Want-Digest` header with the value `SHA-1`, e.g.:

`curl -v -X HEAD -H 'Want-Digest: SHA-1' http://localhost:8000/mockrepository/rest/2`

If the `{id}` is valid, the response will contain the `Digest` header containing the specified SHA-1 hash:

```
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8000 (#0)
> HEAD /mockrepository/rest/2 HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8000
> User-Agent: curl/7.58.0
> Accept: */*
> Want-Digest: SHA-1
> 
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Host: localhost:8000
< Date: Thu, 20 Sep 2018 05:28:57 -0700
< Connection: close
< X-Powered-By: PHP/7.2.7-0ubuntu0.18.04.2
< Cache-Control: no-cache, private
< Date: Thu, 20 Sep 2018 12:28:57 GMT
< Digest: b1d5781111d84f7b3fe45a0852e59758cd7a87e5
< Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
< 
* Closing connection 0
```

If the resource is not found, the response will be `404`. If the `{id}` is not valid for some other reason, the HTTP response will be `400`.

## More about Riprap

### Plugins

One of Riprap's principle design requirements is flexibility. To meet this goal, it uses plugins to process most of its input and output. It supports four types of plugins:

* "fetchresourcelist" plugins fetch a set of resource URIs/URLs to fixity check (e.g., from a Fedora repository's triplestore, from Drupal, from a CSV file). Multiple fetchresourcelist plugins can be configured at once.
   * A plugin is available that queries Drupal for a list of nodes of a specific content type (e.g. "islandora_repository"). To use this plugin, the Drupal site must have the [JSON:API](https://www.drupal.org/project/jsonapi) Drupal module installed and enabled.
   * There is also a sample plugin that reads resource URLs from a text file, `app:riprap:plugin:fetch:from:file`.
* "fetchdigest" plugins query an external utility or service to get the digest of the current resource. Only one fetchdigest plugin can be configured.
   * A plugin is available that queries a Fedora API Specification-compliant repository, `app:riprap:plugin:fetchdigest:from:fedoraapi`.
* "persist" plugins persist data after performing a fixity check on each resource (e.g. to a RDBMS, back into the Fedora repository that manages the resources, etc.). Multiple persist plugins can be configured at once.
   * A plugin is available to persist fixity events to a relational database, `app:riprap:plugin:persist:to:database`.
* "postcheck" plugins execute after performing a fixity check on each resource. Multiple postcheck plugins can be configured at once. Two plugins of this type currently exist (but neither one is complete yet): a plugin that sends an email on failure, `app:riprap:plugin:postcheck:mailfailures`, and a plugin that migrates fixity events from Fedora 3.x AUDIT data.

A second set of simple example plugins is included in the `resources/filesystemexample/src/Command` directory. See their [README.md](resources/filesystemexample/README.md) file for more information.

### Message queue listener

Riprap will also be able to listen to an ActiveMQ queue and generate corresponding fixity events for newly added or updated resources. Not implemented yet.

### Security

* Riprap retrieves fixity digests from other applications via HTTP or some other mechanism. If Riprap is used with a Fedora-based repository, it needs access to the repository's REST interface in order to request resources' digests.
* Riprap also provides a REST interface so other applications can retrieve fixity check event data from it and add/modify fixity check event data. Using Symfony's firewall to provide IP-based access to the API should provide sufficient security.
